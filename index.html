      <p>
        Modifications include:
        <ul>
          <li>Use array length instead of constants on <i>ships</i> array and <i>ship.location</i> array. This allows any number of ships and different ships length by merely modifying the initial values in the <i>ships</i> array</li>
          <li>Moved images and style information to appropriate subdirectory</li>
          <li>Added <i>name</i> property to <i>ship</i> object to display when ship is sunk.</li>
          <li>Replaced literal construction of a 'ship' with a 'Ship' construction function</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      Current version has a single 4 ship (Battleship), two 3 ships (Cruiser), one 2 ship (Destroyer).<br>
